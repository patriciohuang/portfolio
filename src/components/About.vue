        <p class="pb-2">Hello! My name is Patricio and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in 
          web development started back in 2020 when I decided to start studying web development â€” turns out 
          hacking together a custom button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!</p>
        <p class="pb-2"> I have yet to find my first development job, but I do have some experience gained when building 
          several projects for the different courses during my studies. </p>
        <p class="pb-2">In my previous working experiences, I collaborated in multidisciplinary teams with people with 
          different points of view, from sales to operations to IT. I learned that by helping each other, 
          we come up with better solutions and achieve greater results. </p>
